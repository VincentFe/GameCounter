# GameCounter - TypeScript Project

This project has been converted from JavaScript to TypeScript for better type safety and development experience.

## Project Structure

```

```

## Development Workflow

### Build the project
Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Run the application
Start the server using the compiled JavaScript:
```bash
npm start
```

### Development mode
Build and run in one command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## How It Works

1. **Source files (.ts)**: All source code is written in TypeScript in the `src/` directory
2. **Compilation**: The `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) compiles `.ts` files to `.js` files in the `dist/` directory
3. **Runtime**: The Node.js server runs the compiled JavaScript from the `dist/` directory using ES modules

## Key Features

- ✅ Full TypeScript support with strict type checking
- ✅ Proper type annotations for all functions and classes
- ✅ Source maps for debugging compiled code
- ✅ ES modules for both source and compiled code
- ✅ Node.js type definitions included

## Making Changes

Edit files in the `src/` directory (not in `dist/`). The `dist/` folder is auto-generated during compilation.

Example:
- Edit: `src/models/Game.ts`
- Run: `npm run build`
- Result: Compiled to `dist/models/Game.js`
